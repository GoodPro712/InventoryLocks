Inventory Locks is a mod to help you organize your inventory better. Ever wanted to stop items going in your hotbar but have a free slot?
This mod allows you to alt left click (the default favorite hotkey) a blank spot in the player's inventory (had to method swap oof). When favoriting a blank spot, a lock will appear which can't be picked up with the cursor (another method swap). To remove this lock, unfavorite it and it will turn to air.

This mod took a long time to make... enjoy!

Original mod idea by Crimsoneeye, who got me to rework it. (meaning the lock sprite is his)

I got a lot of help with this mod but it mainly comes down to Jopojelly and Darth Wankstain, thanks.
